# Phase 1 Implementation Summary - Crop Watering Schedule

## Overview

Phase 1 of the crop watering schedule feature has been successfully implemented, providing core schedule generation logic and basic UI components for tracking crop watering and harvest times.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Store (`useWateringSchedule`)
- **Location**: `apps/web/stores/useWateringSchedule.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Schedule generation from current garden state
  - Start/stop schedule tracking
  - Mark days as completed/incomplete
  - Get upcoming actions and today's actions
  - Real-world time conversion using existing Palia time system

### 2. Time Utilities (`palia-time.ts`)
- **Location**: `apps/web/lib/utils/palia-time.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Enhanced time conversion functions
  - Harvest boost time calculations
  - Duration formatting utilities
  - Consistent with existing TimeDisplay component logic

### 3. Schedule Control Panel
- **Location**: `apps/web/components/widgets/schedule-control-panel.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Start/Stop schedule button
  - Schedule status display
  - Next action countdown
  - Today's actions summary
  - Integration with Palia harvest boost timing

### 4. Daily Schedule Widget
- **Location**: `apps/web/components/widgets/daily-schedule-widget.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - 7-day schedule view (configurable)
  - Action type indicators (water/harvest)
  - Crop details with images and counts
  - Mark tasks as completed
  - Real-world time display

### 5. Integration System
- **Location**: `apps/web/hooks/useScheduleIntegration.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic schedule regeneration when garden changes
  - Seamless integration with existing garden state management

## Key Features Implemented

### Schedule Generation Logic
- **Harvest Timing**: Calculates when crops are ready for harvest based on growth time and reharvest cycles
- **Watering Logic**: Determines daily watering needs considering:
  - Natural Water Retention bonus (Tomato, Potato, Napa Cabbage)
  - Skips watering on harvest days (harvest includes watering)
  - Future-ready for fertilizer and adjacency bonus integration

### Time Conversion System
- **Palia to Real-World**: Uses 6:00 AM Palia time (harvest boost) as reference point
- **Consistency**: Aligns with existing TimeDisplay component (15 minutes past each real hour)
- **Schedule Alignment**: Actions scheduled at optimal harvest boost times

### User Experience
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded actions (blue for water, green for harvest)
- **Progress Tracking**: Mark days as completed with visual feedback
- **Real-Time Updates**: Shows time until next action
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## How to Use

### Starting a Schedule
1. Set up your garden with crops
2. Click "Start Schedule" in the Schedule Control Panel
3. The system generates a 30-day schedule automatically

### Viewing Schedule
- **Control Panel**: Shows next action and today's tasks
- **Daily Schedule**: Detailed 7-day view with all actions
- **Real-Time**: Updates show time remaining until next action

### Managing Tasks
- Click the circle icon next to any day to mark it as completed
- Completed days show with reduced opacity
- Schedule automatically regenerates when garden changes

## Technical Details

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface ScheduleEntry {
  day: number                    // Palia day number
  earthTime: Date               // Real-world time
  actions: ScheduleAction[]     // Water/harvest actions
  isCompleted: boolean          // User completion status
}
```

### Integration Points
- **Garden State**: Automatically detects crop changes
- **Time System**: Uses existing Palia time conversion logic
- **UI Components**: Integrated into existing stats display

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Generation**: Only generates schedule when active
- **Efficient Updates**: Only regenerates when garden actually changes
- **Memory Management**: Limits schedule to 30 days ahead

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)

The implementation is designed to easily support future enhancements:

1. **Advanced Fertilizer Logic**: HydratePro and adjacency bonuses
2. **Calendar Integration**: Export to external calendar apps
3. **Notifications**: Browser and sound notifications
4. **Multi-tile Crop Support**: Enhanced logic for trees and bushes
5. **Replanting Actions**: Automatic replanting suggestions

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
- **Integration**: Seamless connection with existing garden system
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when garden data is unavailable
- **Performance**: Efficient schedule generation and updates

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `apps/web/stores/useWateringSchedule.ts`
- `apps/web/lib/utils/palia-time.ts`
- `apps/web/components/widgets/schedule-control-panel.tsx`
- `apps/web/components/widgets/daily-schedule-widget.tsx`
- `apps/web/hooks/useScheduleIntegration.ts`

### Modified Files
- `apps/web/stores/index.ts` - Added new store exports
- `apps/web/components/stats-display.tsx` - Integrated new widgets
- `apps/web/components/garden-planner.tsx` - Added schedule integration

## Conclusion

Phase 1 successfully delivers the core functionality outlined in the feature specification, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements while maintaining consistency with the existing codebase architecture and design patterns.
