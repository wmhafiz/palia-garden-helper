# Palia Garden Helper UI/UX Redesign Plan

## Executive Summary

Transform the current accordion-heavy interface into a clean, contextual tool-based design that adapts to user workflow stages. The new design will reduce cognitive load while maintaining all functionality through smart progressive disclosure and mode-based architecture that properly accommodates the rich feature set of the current implementation.

## Current State Analysis

### Problems Identified

- **Information Overload**: 14+ widgets and accordions visible simultaneously causing cognitive burden
- **Accordion Fatigue**: Heavy reliance on accordion-based layout creates navigation friction
- **Context Switching Confusion**: Tools for different activities (planting, fertilizing, scheduling, analysis) compete for attention
- **Workflow Ambiguity**: No clear guidance on task sequence or current activity focus
- **Visual Clutter**: Competing elements draw attention away from primary tasks
- **Feature Discoverability**: Rich functionality hidden behind multiple accordion layers

### Strengths to Preserve

- **Comprehensive Feature Set**: 14 specialized widgets covering all aspects of garden management
- **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed crop statistics, gold value calculations, and processing optimization
- **Sophisticated Scheduling**: Calendar system, watering schedules, and daily task management
- **Real-time Calculations**: Live bonus calculations and optimization recommendations
- **Visual Garden Layout**: Clear grid-based planting visualization with multi-size crop support
- **Time Management**: Effective handling of Palia's 24x time acceleration
- **Undo/Redo System**: Comprehensive action history and state management
- **Save/Load Compatibility**: Backward compatibility with Vue.js save codes

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Context-Driven Interface**: Show only relevant tools and information for current activity
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal complexity gradually as needed while preserving access to all features
3. **Task-Oriented Design**: Organize around user workflows, not data structures
4. **Minimal Cognitive Load**: One primary focus area at a time with contextual support
5. **Seamless Transitions**: Smooth flow between different modes with state preservation
6. **Feature Preservation**: Maintain all existing functionality while improving accessibility
